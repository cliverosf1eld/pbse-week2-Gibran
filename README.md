# 🏸 PBSE Week 2 - Group Assignment
## Public URL: https://pbse-week2.vercel.app/v1/courts

Welcome to the repository for **Week 2 Group Assignment** in **Platform Based Software Engineering (PBSE)**.

---

## Project Overview

This repository contains the codebase and deliverables developed during Week 2 of the Platform Based Software Engineering course. The project focuses on setting up foundational platform architectures, modular component design, and collaborative software development practices.

* Badminton Court Booking System: A customer books the available court and the staff checks and confirms it on the system
* Interface: openapi.yaml (repository root)
* Deployment URL: _not deployed yet - see docs/deployment.md_
* Deploying: docs/deployment.md
* Run the mock: cd spec && npm install && npm run mock

|---|---|---|---|---:|
| Browse courts | Court list | Student | GET /v1/courts | 1 |
| Browse courts | Court detail | Student | GET /v1/courts/{courtId} | 1 |
| Create booking | Booking form | Student | POST /v1/bookings | 1 |
| Create booking | Booking confirmation | Student | GET /v1/bookings/{bookingId} | 1 |
| View and cancel booking | Booking list | Student | GET /v1/bookings | 1 |
| View and cancel booking | Booking detail | Student | GET /v1/bookings/{bookingId} | 1 |
| View and cancel booking | Cancellation form | Student | POST /v1/bookings/{bookingId}/cancellation | 1 |
| Manage courts | Court management list | Administrator | GET /v1/courts | 1 |

| Manage courts | Retirement form | Administrator | POST /v1/courts/{courtId}/retirement | 1 |

## A.3 Session Storage and Security

The browser client uses the Keycloak JavaScript adapter for authentication. Access and refresh tokens are kept in memory by the Keycloak adapter and are not stored in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.

The browser only uses `sessionStorage` for the temporary `a3-return-to` value. This value stores the application path that the user was viewing before authentication was required, so the application can return the user to the same screen after signing in. It is not an authentication credential.

Keeping authentication tokens in memory reduces the risk of exposing reusable tokens through persistent browser storage. The consequence is that the tokens are lost when the page is fully reloaded. The application can then use the Keycloak SSO session to check whether the user is still authenticated and obtain a new session if possible.

When the API returns `401 Unauthorized`, the browser clears the local authentication state, remembers the current location, and offers the user a sign-in action.

When the API returns `403 Forbidden`, the browser explains that the authenticated user does not have the required permission and does not send the user through the sign-in flow again.

When the API returns `404 Not Found` for a specific resource, the browser shows a generic not-found message without revealing whether the resource exists for another user.

Signing out clears the local authentication state and calls the Keycloak logout endpoint.

## A.2 Application Skeleton and Routing

The browser client lives in `web/` (React + Vite). It is one client of the
service among several possible ones, and holds no rules of its own.

**One address per screen.** Every workflow in the A.1 table is reachable by
URL, so any screen can be linked, bookmarked, and reopened in a second tab
without losing its place.

| Address | Screen |
|---|---|
| `/` | redirects to `/courts` |
| `/courts` | court list |
| `/courts/{courtId}` | court detail |
| `/bookings` | the signed-in student's bookings |
| `/bookings/new` | booking form |
| `/bookings/{bookingId}` | booking detail |
| `/admin/courts` | court management |
| `/callback` | returns from Keycloak to the remembered address |
| anything else | not-found screen |

No screen keeps its identity in a component variable. `/bookings/{id}`
re-fetches from the id in the URL, which is why opening it in a new tab
shows the same booking rather than the start page.

**One network layer.** `web/src/services/api.js` is the only file that calls
`fetch`. It owns the base URL, attaches the `Authorization` header, and
turns error responses into `ApiError`. Views call domain functions —
`getCourts()`, `cancelBooking()` — so that uniform 401 handling, ETag
bookkeeping, and a base URL that changes at deployment each have exactly one
place to live.

**Navigation reflects role, and that is all it does.** The court-management
link is rendered only for a token carrying `courts:write`. This is user
experience, not access control: the address can still be typed in directly,
and when it is, the service refuses the API calls behind it (A.9).

**Configuration comes from the environment.** `web/.env.example` lists every
variable; copy it to `web/.env.local`. Both the service base URL and the
Keycloak URL, realm, and client id are read from it, so nothing has to be
edited in source to deploy. Vite inlines every `VITE_`-prefixed variable
into the bundle where any visitor can read it, so no secret is kept there.

One variable is not an address: `VITE_KEYCLOAK_SCOPES`. Scopes marked
*optional* on a Keycloak client are absent from the access token unless the
client asks for them, and `bookings:write` is optional on
`badminton-student-web`. Without requesting it, the application signs a
student in successfully and then receives 403 on every booking it tries to
create.

## A.4 Same-origin Policy and CORS

The web application and the service are different origins — different
scheme, host, and port — so the service states which origins may read its
replies. This is configured in `service/src/middleware/cors.js` and is
covered by `service/tests/cors/cors.test.js` in CI.

**The allow-list is explicit.** Origins come from `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, a
comma-separated list. The incoming `Origin` header is never reflected back:
reflecting it passes every "does cross-origin work?" test while in fact
permitting every origin on the internet, because the check can never fail.
`Vary: Origin` is sent on every response, including refused ones, so a
shared cache cannot serve one origin's allow-header to a page from another.

**The preflight is answered above the authentication layer.** A request
carrying `Authorization` and `Content-Type: application/json` is not simple,
so the browser first sends `OPTIONS` with `Access-Control-Request-Method`
and `-Request-Headers`. That preflight carries no token — it is asking
permission to send one. If it reached `app.use(authenticate)` every
cross-origin write would fail with a 401 that had nothing to do with the
user's session.

**`ETag` is exposed deliberately.** Browsers hide all but a short default
list of response headers from the page. An `ETag` the client cannot read is
one it cannot send back in `If-None-Match`, so A.7 would silently never
produce a 304. `If-Match` and `If-None-Match` are likewise already in the
allowed request headers, so A.8 does not fail at the preflight.

**CORS is not access control.** It governs what the browser lets a page
*read*, not what the service does. A request from an unlisted origin is
still delivered and still processed — the test
`an unlisted origin's real request is still processed` asserts exactly that,
and gets a 201. "CORS blocked it, so the booking was never created" is
false. Every rule that matters is enforced by the authorisation layers from
Session 4, which is what A.9 verifies.
